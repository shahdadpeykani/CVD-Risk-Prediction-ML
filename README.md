# CVD-Risk-Prediction-ML
A machine learning project to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using health parameters. This repository includes data analysis, model training, and evaluation for early detection of CVD to reduce mortality and healthcare costs.

Key Features:
  Dataset: 70,000 patient records with 11 features (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, lifestyle indicators, etc.) from Kaggle.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, correlation analysis, and insights into feature distributions.
  
  Model Comparison: Logistic Regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM.
  
  Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV (best accuracy: 71.25%).
  
  Evaluation Metrics: ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies Used:
  Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

Impact:
  Designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early, enabling timely interventions.
